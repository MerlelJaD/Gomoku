# Gomoku with a Computer Opponent

This is a Python 3 implementation of the classic Gomoku game (also known as Five in a Row) for the **MATH20621 Programming with Python** course. The game can be played by:
- Two human players
- A human against the computer
- The computer against itself

The project is designed to be played on an 8x8 grid, and the goal is to be the first player to place five pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
